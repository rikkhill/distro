Probability distributions in JavaScript

This is the wrong tool for the wrong problem, but I still think it needs to be made. I have occasionally needed to sample from a specific probability distribution in JavaScript, and haven't found an existing library to let me do this.

Implementing a form of rejection sampling, this should (provided it doesn't turn out to be a non-performant abject failure) provide samples from useful, common probability distributions, as well as allowing custom-defined distributions.
